TDEX Analytics provides historical data about balances and prices of Liquidity Providers registered in the [tdex-registry](https://github.com/tdex-network/tdex-registry).

It periodically polls Liquidity Provider's registry and fetches all available markets and their market price and balances and fills a time-series DB with data that are accessible through gRPC & JSON HTTP APIs.

API specifications can be found in [here](https://github.com/tdex-network/tdex-analytics/blob/master/api-spec/protobuf/tdexa/v1).
